# dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. Everyone is welcome to fork.

## Requirements

I used `gnu make`. For reference, please take a look at the `makefile`.

## Installation

There are many modules, each in their respective directory, that can be installed separately. For example, `bash` and `nvim` configurations can be installed using the provided install script with
```sh
./install bash nvim
```
